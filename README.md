**Instructions**:  
You can open this repository as a *R Studio Project* that automatically sets the `MLCompetition folder` as default (please, if you decide to do other approach remember to set this folder as the working directory).
The code to test our final GBM choice is located at: `Code-> Mehod-GBM -> R code`.  
**Please remember that the H2o package runs on `Java Virtual Machine` , it uses the `RJava` package. If you are using the AWS machine with the Rstudio image you have to to install `JVM` and `RJava` from the command line**.
